# CHealthAnalysis
A project that analyses symptoms and attempts to provide potential ailments being experienced as well as other symptoms to look out for, cures (if any are available) and precautions while providing a reliability value based on how many symptoms match up with what's been inputted.

## How does it work?
The user provides a list of symptoms and the program will return health issues that match up with the symptoms provided, a list of symptoms for each of the returned ailments that the user should watch out for, a list of possible cures the user can undergo or partake in if possible, any precautions that can be taken by the user to maintain their safety and upkeep general health to the best of their abilities, and finally a probability value which would depict how reliable a returned diagnoses is.

## Why the name CHealthAnalysis?
I originally was making this project in Python as that is the language I am most familiar with, however I wanted to challenge myself and learn C# so I wanted to recreate that project in C#, to reflect this change in language I decided to make a second repository so that I can possibly simulataneously work on both projects and apply what new concepts I learn in Python into C#.
